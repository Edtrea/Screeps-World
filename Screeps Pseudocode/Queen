A Queen is responsible for the management of a single room
Stores the following in memory:
    Current stage/controller level of the room
    Current state of the room
    Count of each type of creeps born from the room and is still alive
At regular intervals (10 ticks) the queen will check and update the current room stage and the state in the memory
At every tick, it will cross-check existing worker creeps and the memory for any dead worker creep. It will call spawner to spawn new creep with the dead creep's memory to replace them.
